An autonomous drone was deployed to capture aerial imagery of a specific land area. The drone carried a camera setup capable of storing geo-location data of each image captured. The collected images were processed to generate an orthomosaic map, a composite image composed of multiple overlapping, geometrically corrected photographs. This map was used to accurately calculate the area of the land under consideration."
